### Package `sounddevice`

```

### Package `soundfile`

The package `soundfile` (formerly known as `pysoundfile`) is a wrapper
around `libsndfile` allowing to read and write sound files in Python.

```sh
pip install SoundFile
```


## Miscellaneous packages

### `setproctitle` (optional)

The package [setproctitle](https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle)
allows to get and set the process title (shown by the `ps` command).
Currently this is purely cosmetic and not installing `setproctitle`
will have no negative impact (all functionality will still be available).
Installation of `setproctitle` can be done by:

```sh
pip install setproctitle
```
