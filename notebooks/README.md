## Notes about deep learning frameworks
These notes provide some insights into common deep learning frameworks supported by qtpyviz. Each directory correspond to
one framework and contains the notebooks `train`, `inference` and `introspection`.
The notebooks demonstrate how training and inference can be
achieved in the frameworks and what kind of introspection methods the frameworks offer.
