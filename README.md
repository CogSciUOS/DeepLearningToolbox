PyQt5 visualization of Deep Neural Networks (Development stage)
===============================================================
One can use this code to visualize DNNs (activations, filters, network structure).

Main goal of the toolbox is to visualize networks that solve image classifications tasks. Current version assumes to be given a model trained and saved using [Keras: The Python Deep Learning library](https://keras.io/ "Keras's Homepage")
Creating thins toolbox was motivated by this paper:

 - Jason Yosinski, Jeff Clune, Anh Nguyen, Thomas Fuchs, and Hod Lipson. [Understanding neural networks through deep visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06579/ "Computer Science > Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition") Presented at the Deep Learning Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2015.
